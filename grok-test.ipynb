While the launch of DeepSeek\\'s R1 initially led to some analysts tempering their forecasts as they questioned whether money pumped into the sector might have been somewhat \"misguided,\" experts told CNBC that models built more cheaply and with less powerful chips could ultimately become an accelerant for the market. The jury is \"still out\" on whether DeepSeek needed 20 to 30 times less computing power per query for inference, Andre Kukhnin, equity research analyst at UBS, told CNBC — referring to the process of running data through an AI model to make a prediction or solve a task.'}], 'response_time': 1.85}\n",

The general themes discussed (AI in biotech, AI in defense, AI in healthcare, etc.) are credible and widely discussed, but the specific details provided in these news items appear to be unverified or speculative. It's important to approach such news with caution and seek out multiple sources for confirmation.\n"
